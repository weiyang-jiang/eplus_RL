<h1>Help for the Hybrid System Visual Modeler</h1>
<p>
A hybrid system is a continuous-time model that contains modal models.
The top-level continuous time is provided with a <i>director</i>
(also called a <i>solver</i>),
represented by a green box, which represents the simulation engine that
executes the model.  A user constructs a model by dragging in actors
from the actor library and connecting them.  The model may be run from
the toolbar or from the View menu.  The duration of a run may be
specified by double clicking on the director.
<p>
To construct a simple
continuous-time model, try dragging a TimedSinewave actor from the
sources library and a TimedPlotter from the sinks library
(both sublibraries of the actor library) and connecting them by clicking
and dragging from one port to another.
<p>
To construct a hybrid system, drag in a Modal Model from the utilities
library.  The following steps will configure the modal model:
<ul>
<li> Right click to configure the ports. Add an input and an output port.
<li> Right click to look inside the modal model.
<li> Populate the modal model with a state machine.
</ul>
