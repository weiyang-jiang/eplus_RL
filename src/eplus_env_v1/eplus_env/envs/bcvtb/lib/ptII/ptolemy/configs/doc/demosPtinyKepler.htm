    Ptolemy II can be used to build sophisticated application domain-specific modeling capabilities
    and frameworks. These frameworks can be packaged as separate executable
    applications (e.g. HyVisual or VisualSense)
    or accessed from within Ptolemy II. Here, we illustrate some such frameworks.

	A modal model is one whose behavior depends on its "mode"
	of operation. A modal model in Ptolemy II heterogeneously combines the
	<i>finite state machine</i> (FSM) domain
	combined hierarchically with other models. A state in the FSM represents
	a mode of operation, and can have a refinement that gives the behavior
	in that mode.
	The refinement can be another FSM or some other model using some other
	Ptolemy domain. The <a href="../../domains/de/demo/ModalModel/ModalModel.xml">ModalModel</a> example combines DE, FSM, and SDF to model a
	system where regularly sampled signals are perturbed by irregular
	events in time.

    <h2>
      <a name="basic">Basic Modeling Capabilities</a>
    </h2>


    Many common models of computation have been implemented in
    Ptolemy II.  This section illustrates some of them.
    <ul>



      <li><i>Synchronous Dataflow</i>:
	<a href="../../domains/sdf/demo/Spectrum/Spectrum.xml">Spectrum</a> (See also
	<a href="../../domains/sdf/demo/MaximumEntropySpectrum/MaximumEntropySpectrum.xml">MaximumEntropySpectrum</a>,
	<a href="../../domains/sdf/demo/FourierSeries/FourierSeries.xml">FourierSeries</a>, and
	<a href="../../domains/sdf/demo/SoundSpectrum/SoundSpectrum.xml">SoundSpectrum</a>)
	<br>

	This example shows simple spectral estimation of the product
	of two sinusoids in noise.  It illustrates models the use of synchronous dataflow (SDF) for signal
	processing, and also shows many basic capabilities like
	hierarchical models,
	the Expression actor, and the signal processing actor library.
	In SDF, the firing of actors is statically scheduled, and at the start of execution,
	boundedness and deadlock conditions are checked.


	<br>



      </li>

      <li><i>Continuous-Time Modeling</i>:
	<a href="../../domains/continuous/demo/Lorenz/Lorenz.xml">Lorenz</a> (see also
	<a href="../../domains/continuous/demo/Lorenz/LorenzDifferentialSystem.xml">Lorenz with DifferentialSystem</a>,
	<a href="../../domains/continuous/demo/SquareWave/SquareWave.xml">SquareWave</a>,
	<a href="../../domains/continuous/demo/Sinusoid/Sinusoid.xml">Sinusoid</a>)
	<br>

	This example shows a continuous-time
	nonlinear feedback system that exhibits
	chaotic behavior (this system is called a Lorenz attractor).
	It illustrates the <i>continuous</i> domain,
	which uses an underlying solver for ordinary differential equations
	and cleanly supports mixtures of discrete events and continuous-time
	signals.

      <!--/bcvtbDocs-->
      <li><i>Discrete-Event Modeling</i>:

	<!-- Router uses DEDirector, which is not in bcvtb -->
	<a href="../../data/type/demo/Router/Router.xml">Router</a>,
	and <a href="../../domains/de/demo/TimingParadox/TimingParadox.xml">TimingParadox</a>
	).

	<br>

	This example shows
	a famous paradox in probability called the inspection paradox.
	It illustrates use of the <i>discrete-event</i> (DE) domain, where
	events occur on a time line and are processed chronologically.
	In this example, random
	data stimulates a model and statistics are collected and reported
	in various ways.

	<a href="../../domains/pn/demo/NondeterministicMerge/NondeterministicMerge.xml">NondeterministicMerge</a>,
	<a href="../../domains/pn/demo/QR/QR.xml">QR</a>).
	<br>


	The process networks (PN) domain follows the semantics given by Kahn and MacQueen in 1977
	to get processes with their own threads of control that send messages to one another
	and achieve deterministic computation.
	The <a href="../../domains/pn/demo/OrderedMerge/OrderedMerge.xml">OrderedMerge</a> example implements an example given by Kahn and MacQueen
	that calculates numbers whose prime
	factors are 2, 3, and 5, only, and produces
	them in an ordered sequence.
	As of version 5.0, we have extended this model of computation with a
	nondeterministic merge actor, illustrated in
	<a href="../../domains/pn/demo/NondeterministicMerge/NondeterministicMerge.xml">NondeterministicMerge</a>.

    <h2>
      <a name="infrastructure">Modeling Infrastructure</a>
    </h2>


    Ptolemy II models are built on an underlying framework that provides a rich
    set of generic capabilities that are available in all models.
    This section illustrates that infrastructure.
    <ul>

      <!--/bcvtbDocs-->
      <li><i>The Type System</i>:
	<a href="../../data/type/demo/Router/Router.xml">Router</a>.
	<br>


	This model illustrates the very sophisticated type system
	of Ptolemy II, where type constraints propagate transparently,
	actors are polymorphic, and composite types such as records and
	arrays are supported.
	This example illustrates composite types, where records are
	constructed out of tokens with various types. Here, a record
	models a packet in a packet-switched network, where variable
	delays may result in out-of-order arrival of packets.

      </li>

      <li><i>Expression Language</i>:
	<a href="../../domains/continuous/demo/Transmission/Transmission.xml">Transmission</a>.
	<br>


	To simplify creating new components, Ptolemy II contains a functional
	expression language.  The expression language is integrated with the
	type system, allowing static type checking of polymorphic expressions
	with few type annotations.  The expression language also allows new,
	encapsulated functions, called function closures, to be defined and
	passed as data.  This model illustrates how function closures can be
	used to make models much more compact.

      <li><i>Interactive Signal Plotter</i>:
	<a href="../../domains/sdf/demo/Sketch/Sketch.xml">Sketch</a>
	(see also <a href="../../domains/sdf/demo/FourierSeries/FourierSeries.xml">FourierSeries</a>).
	<br>


	This model illustrates the use of plotter to provide input
	as well as rendering output from a model.  Right click and drag
	on the plot to trace out a new signal. The model runs each time you
	do this.

	(see also
	<a href="../../matlab/demo/MatlabContinuous/MatlabContinuous.xml">Matlab in Continuous</a>).

	<br>


	This example uses the Matlab interface created by
	Zoltan Kemenczy and Sean Simmons, of Research in Motion Ltd.,
	to plot a 3-D surface. This works only if Matlab is installed locally.

	<!--bcvtbDocs-->  
	).
	<br>


	Actor-oriented classes, subclasses, and
	inner classes with inheritance are a special feature of Ptolemy II.
	They provide modularity mechanisms analogous to those of object-oriented
	design, but adapted to actor-oriented design. This capability permits, for
	example, defining a class of models that can have instances and subclasses.
	The instances and subclasses inherit all the features of the class, and
	track any changes that are made to the class.

	<br>


	Ptolemy II models can, while executing, control their visual rendition
	in Vergil, the visual editor for Ptolemy II.
	In this example, a model alters the position in the Vergil diagram
	of one of its own actors.

	(see also
	<a href="../../data/unit/demo/Units/Units.xml">Units</a>, the
	dynamically checked units system).
	<!--bcvtbDocs-->
	<br>


	This model illustrates the use of the statically
	checked units system. A unit system
	defines a set of interrelated dimensions and measures. For example, in
	the time dimension, we might have seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks,
	and fortnights. Ptolemy II includes two experimental units systems,
	one that is statically checked and one that is dynamically checked.

	<br>



      </li>

      <li><i>Network Integration</i>:
	<a href="../../moml/demo/Networked/Networked.xml">Networked</a>.<br>


	This example illustrates that models may be defined in a networked,
	distributed fashion.
	This model contains a component that is defined on the Ptolemy project
	website.  When you open the model, you will be alerted to the fact
	that it requires loading a model definition from a remote source.
	If you agree to proceed, then you will have a model with a remotely
	defined component.  The component itself is at
	<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/xml/models/Waveform.xml#in_browser" target="_top">http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/xml/models/Waveform.xml</a>.
	You can open that definition by clicking on the hyperlink, or by
	using the "Open URL" command in the File menu.

	<br>


	Ptolemy II includes actors that interface to the audio system on
	the executing machine, assuming it has one.
	This example shows the Karplus-Strong algorithm, which synthesizes
	a musical sound that closely resembles a plucked string instrument.
	It illustrates the audio capabilities of Ptolemy II.
