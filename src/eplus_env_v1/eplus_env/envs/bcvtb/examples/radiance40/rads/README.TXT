README.TXT for Virtual Fenestration Testbed
-------------------------------------------

by Luis Fernandes 6 Mar 2007

This is a list of files and directories comprising the Virtual Fenestration Testbed (VFT). Directories are indicated with a '/' at the end of their name.

1. Data generation
------------------

WARNING: This section of this document may not be complete. I may have missed important files in /archive/projects/ecoffice.

compDC.csh	C-shell script that computes daylight coefficients for a given facade (flat or over), EC window pane (upper or lower) and blind configuration (deployment and angle).

views/	Contains Radiance view files for data generation. View used for current image data set was newsitfish.vf . Views for sensors are sensor1.vf and sensor2.vf.

room_basic.rad, VDToff.rad, mullions.rad, surround.rad overhang.rad, bot_glass.rad, top_glass.rad	Radiance scene files for the office in building 71T.

chair1.oct	Radiance octree for chair.

redvase.oct	Radiance octree for vase.

keyboard.rad	Radiance scene file for keyboard.

myblinds.csh	C-shell script that generates a Radiance description of Venetian blinds according to specified height and angle.

tregsky.rad	See section 3.

approx.mat	Radiance scene file with materials used in room model.

sensor1.flt, sensor2.flt	Floating-point ray files for photosensors. If comptDC.csh cannot find them, they're generated by calling mksensors.csh.

mksensors.csh	Generates floating-point ray files for photosensors.

tregsuns.txt	Text file with names of all 145 solar positions. Used by compDC.csh.

tregenza.cal	Radiance function file that computes Tregenza patch numbers according to sky sampling ray direction. Used by compDC.csh.

2. Data
-------

The following directories contain the coefficient data used for the daylight and electrical lighting calculations.

DC/	Contains daylight coefficient images and photosensor data for each facade configuration (flat or over, every blind position).

elec/	Contains images and photosensor data for electric lighting. Original images (E*.hdr) were filtered to produce images with the same resolution as the ones in /DC, resulting in the images named FE*.hdr, which were then used for the electric lighting calculations. The text files FE*.txt have the pixel values of those images. These files were used to calculate the effect of electric lighting on the workplane (in illuminance_elec.nb).

3. Hourly simulation
--------------------

These files use the DC coefficients to calculate hourly images and photosensor data.

yearsamp.py	Python script. Main program for performing hourly simulations. Run 'python yearsamp.py' without arguments for usage.

functions.py	Python script with auxiliary functions used in other files, including function for incrementing blind position in yearsamp.py.

sampfuncs.py	Python script with functions for sampling month and year. Used by yearsamp.py to define sampling.

month.py	Python script with definition of Month class, which is used by sampfuncs.py.

momentdata.py	Python script with main data class used for hourly simulation. This main data structure allows the simulation part of yearsamp.py to be relatively simple and flexible.

classes.py	Python script with definition of auxiliary classes for data contained by instances of the MomentData class (defined in momentdata.py).

do_run_ori.csh	C-shell script that generates image and photosensor data for a particular hour of the year. Called by getData method of MomentData class (momentdata.py).

wea_head.fmt	Format file used by do_run_ori.csh for reading weather file.

block_sun_ori.csh	C-shell script that calculates blind position to block direct sun.

/masks		Assorted masks. UpperWindow.bmp, LowerSkyOver.bmp and LowerSky.bmp are used by block_sun_ori.csh to determine if sun is visible through window.

gensky+s.fmt	Format file used by block_sun_ori.csh and excl_angle_ori.csh to read gensky output.

excl_angle_ori.csh	C-shell script that computes slat angle for excluding direct sun.

blinds.cal	Function file for computing solar exclusion blind slat angle.

comp_pcargs_ori.csh	C-shell script that computes coefficients for adding solar and sky patch contributions according to sun position and sky model.

tregsky.rad	Collection of Radiance description of suns positioned at Tregenza patch centers. Used by comp_pcargs_ori.csh to determine four closest suns to actual solar position, for interpolation of solar Daylight Coefficients.

tregsamp.dat	Contains directions for sampling the sky. Total number of directions is 9344, 64 directions for each Tregenza sky patch. Used in comp_pcargs_ori.csh to determine multiplier for each sky patch according to current sky condition.
